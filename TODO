- Bugs:
  - Search underline goes over bottom nav
    - Vuetify issue?
    - change to dialog prompt for input?
  - Scrolling browse and queue lists actually scrolls the whole page. This causes scrolling in
    one to affect the other. A (slightly) hacky-ish work-around is in place, where the page
    position is saved/restored on route change. Would be better to scroll just the list.
    Can probably use --vh setting (as per no playing details) to set list size/pos
  - Drag'n'drop
    - Not working on Android Firefox
    - Not working on iOS - github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/gragdroptouch
    - Desktop firefox has drag thumbnail much higher than item being dragged.
  - Queue not always drawn completely with iOS,  dragging up/down causes items to be shown.
  - Does not work if set as default, can't find files
  - YouTube cover did not show on now-playing, until refresh?

- Browse
  - Random Mix
  - Favorites images
  - Replace ... menu with a play button/long press menu?
  - Usage of URL/ID in list items which determins playlistcontrol or playlist is used.
    Suggest we remove URLs unless needed. Then artist, albums, etc, can juse use ID.
    Would be cleaner.
  - Can't play a non stream favourite - produces error dialog stating don't now how to handle.
    For now, the play/append actions have been removed.

- Now Playing
  - Drag time slider?
  - Set butons to disabled when appropriate
  - If durayion is 0, don't show progress

- PlayQueue
  - Only update whilst visible?

- Misc
  - Minify JS into 1 minified file, and minify css
    devlopers.google.com/closure/compiler - for JS. Need to pass JS files in order that they
    appear in index.html
    yuicompressor.jar for css
  - Complete WebApp support
    - Handle back button (navigate back in browse)
  - Virtual libraries
    - Get list via: ["",["libraries", 0, 100]]
    - Add selection (if any present) to settings dialog, and set vuex/cookie with id
    - Replace "My Music" with library name
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Add 'About dialog'
     - Server version
     - Skin Version
     - Artist, Album, Track count (in virtual library?)
  - Add 'Manage all' to players/settings menu
     - Manage all volumes
     - Power on/off
  - Smarter polling
    - Only poll status every 5 seconds
      - at start of song, and near end poll every (e.g.) 0.5 seconds
    - Create timer to advance song progress - re-adjust on each poll
    - or use ["time", "?"] to just obtain time position every second?
  - Desktop UI - expand the 3 pages into 1. Will needs scrolling fix (above)
