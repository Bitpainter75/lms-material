- Bugs:
  - Drag'n'drop, not working on Android Firefox
  - Issues with virtual scroller
    - Navigate into 'Apps' (when only have a few), and back out; not all items drawn
    - disabled for now

- Browse
  - SlimBrowse
    - Fully handle commands
      - 'More'
      - Check all
  - click() needs to allow itemplay for menu lists.
  - Replace ... menu with a play button/long press menu?
  - Favourites
    - Before showing menu, check if item is in favourites - and adjust entries?

- Misc
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Smarter polling
    - Only poll status every 5 seconds
      - at start of song, and near end poll every (e.g.) 0.5 seconds
    - Create timer to advance song progress - re-adjust on each poll
    - or use ["time", "?"] to just obtain time position every second?

- Queue
  - Set current highlight diffeently for dark/light

- Desktop UI
  - Volume control in toolbar
  - Spinner should be in middle of its view, not page
  - Move desktop.html into 'deskop/index.html' and update plugin.pm to look into this folder
    - Want http://host:9000/material/desktop
