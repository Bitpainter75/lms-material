- Bugs:
  - Drag'n'drop not working on Android Firefox
  - Issues with virtual scroller
    - Navigate into 'Apps' (when only have a few), and back out; not all items drawn
    - disabled for now

- Browse
  - Fully handle SlimBrowse commands - e.g. buttons, radios, checkboxes
  - Before showing menu, check if item is in favourites - and adjust entries?
  - Check grid sizes on various devices

- Misc
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Use CometD for status updates, rather than polling
