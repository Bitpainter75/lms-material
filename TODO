- Bugs:
  - Scrolling browse and queue lists actually scrolls the whole page. This causes scrolling in
    one to affect the other. A (slightly) hacky-ish work-around is in place, where the page
    position is saved/restored on route change. Would be better to scroll just the list.
    Can probably use --vh setting (as per no playing details) to set list size/pos
  - Drag'n'drop, not working on Android Firefox
  - Issues with virtual scroller
    - Navigate into 'Apps' (when only have a few), and back out; not all items drawn
    - disabld for now

- Browse
  - SlimBrowse
    - Fully handle commands
      - 'More'
      - Check all
  - click() needs to allow itemplay for menu lists.
  - Replace ... menu with a play button/long press menu?
  - Favourites
    - Before showing menu, check if item is in favourites - and adjust entries?
    - Add 'new favorite' to toolbar
    - Add 'Move to' to context menu
      - Move to sub-folder
      - Move to parent folder
      - Allow creating new folders
  - When brosing artist->albums, or genre->artist, etc. make passing of artist_id/genre_id optional

- Misc
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Smarter polling
    - Only poll status every 5 seconds
      - at start of song, and near end poll every (e.g.) 0.5 seconds
    - Create timer to advance song progress - re-adjust on each poll
    - or use ["time", "?"] to just obtain time position every second?
  - Desktop UI - expand the 3 pages into 1. Will needs scrolling fix (above)
