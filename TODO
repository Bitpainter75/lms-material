- Bugs:
  - Search underline goes over bottom nav
    - Vuetify issue?
    - change to dialog prompt for input?
  - Scrolling browse and queue lists actually scrolls the whole page. This causes scrolling in
    one to affect the other. A (slightly) hacky-ish work-around is in place, where the page
    position is saved/restored on route change. Would be better to scroll just the list.
  - Drag'n'drop
    - Not working on Android Firefox
    - Not working on iOS
    - Desktop firefox has drag thumbnail much higher than item being dragged.
  - Queue not always drawn completely with iOS,  dragging up/down causes items to be shown.

- Browse
  - Random Mix
  - Favorites images
  - Replace ... menu with a play button/long press menu?

- Now Playing
  - Drag time slider?
  - Set butons to disabled when appropriate

- PlayQueue
  - Only update whilst visible?

- Misc
  - Complete WebApp support
    - Handle back button (navigate back in browse)
  - Group management
    - Add create/delete/edit/list to JSON API in Groups plugin itself.
      ["groupmac", ["playergroup", 0, 100]] lists group details
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "playername", "X"]] sets group name
      ["groupmac", ["playerpref", "plugin.groups:members", ["maca", "macb"]]] sets group members
  - Add 'Manage all' to players/settings menu
     - Manage all volumes
     - Power on/off
  - Smarter polling
    - Only poll status every 5 seconds
      - at start of song, and near end poll every (e.g.) 0.5 seconds
    - Create timer to advance song progress - re-adjust on each poll
    - or use ["time", "?"] to just obtain time position every second?
  - Desktop UI - expand the 3 pages into 1. Will needs scrolling fix (above)
